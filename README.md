# Learning-at-MDN
This repository contains all the test tasks that I did myself while studying at MDN (Mozilla Developer Network).
All html documents were made by me in the process of studying html markup for tasks from the site https://developer.mozilla.org.
Materials (images, audio and video) contained in the repository folders belong to https://developer.mozilla.org or Valentyna Boiko.
HTML docs were verified by https://validator.w3.org.
All CSS-files were copied at https://developer.mozilla.org. The learning of CSS is my next goal.
I've finished  MDN section: HTML â€” Structuring the Web. That is my final result. 

Special thanks to MDN!
